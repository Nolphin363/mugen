 ;This is the amount of power the attacker gets when an attack successfully
 ;hits the opponent. It's a multiplier of the damage done. For example,
 ;for a value of 3, a hit that does 10 damage will give 30 power.

 ;This is like the above, but it's for the person getting hit.
 ;These two multipliers can be overridden in the Hitdef controller in the
 ;CNS by using the "getpower" and "givepower" options.
Default.GetHit.LifeToPowerMul = .6

 ;This controls how much damage a super does when you combo into it.
 ;It's actually a multiplier for the defensive power of the opponent.
 ;A large number means the opponent takes less damage. Leave it at
 ;1 if you want supers to do the normal amount of damage when comboed
 ;into.
 ;Note 1: this increase in defence stays effective until the opponent
 ;        gets up from the ground.
 ;Note 2: the program knows you've done a super when the "superpause"
 ;        controller is executed. That's the instance when this change
